  abstract    = {The emerging new paradigm of technologies, the internet of things, entails a process of device miniaturization to combine several functional components, such as sensors, actuators, and powering elements, in a single individual on-chip platform. An essential requirement is for the devices to have a small footprint and thus to be extended over three-dimensions to present adequate performance. A suitable technique to realize devices of complex architectures and virtually any size is three-dimensional printing. So far its use has seen applications exclusively at the macroscale. Here we report the first 3D printed architectures via robocasting of two-dimensional atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides demonstrating their use as miniaturizable supercapacitors. The structures are fabricated via direct printing of a liquid ink of chemically exfoliated 2D nanosheets. The 3D printed architectures present footprints in the mm2 scale and micron-sized features and they demonstrate mechanical robustness and chemical stability. They exhibit areal capacitance of 1450 mF/cm2, rivalling and surpassing comparable devices. Microsupercapacitors comprising two-dimensional atomically thin sheets can enable miniaturization and upscaleable production technologies for wide-scale adoption.},
