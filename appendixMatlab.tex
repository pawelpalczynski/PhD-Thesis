In order to identify the peaks in the recorded spectra a peak fitting has been performed. In normal conditions at rest the atoms in the sample are found in energy states according to the Boltzmann distribution. Following an excitation by the laser small part of them moves into an excited state from which they then relax back while emitting photons. Due to vibrations of the measurement environment as well thermal vibrations of the atoms which cause minute changes in electrostatic environment in the sold the exact energies of the emitted photons are distributed according to Gaussian distribution.

The spectra were exported from the Wire software used for Renishaw Raman spectrometer and they were then imported into MATLAB. Using "peakfit.m" script from "https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/InteractivePeakFitter.htm" the peaks were fitted with required number of peaks.
