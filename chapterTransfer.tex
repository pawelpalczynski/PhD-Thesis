	\subsection{Introduction}
		The most common method of producing the TMDCs is CVD. During the CVD growth the process the substrate and the sample are heated to very high temperatures, up to 1000 {\degree}C. Because of that there is substantial thermal expansion in both substrate and sample. However due to difference in thermal expansion coefficient between those two elements there is potential build up of thermal strain.
